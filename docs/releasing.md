# Releasing prodex

How a version of `@youdie006/prodex` gets from `main` to npm, and the checks that guard it. Moved here from the README so the README can stay about using the tool.

## Publishing

Publishing to npm runs entirely in CI with **no long-lived token** — auth is npm [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) (OIDC), so nothing needs to store or paste an `NPM_TOKEN`, and every release carries a verifiable `--provenance` attestation.

Release flow:

```bash
# 1. bump version + update CHANGELOG on main, commit, push main
# 2. tag the release and push the tag — CI publishes it
git tag v0.8.2
git push origin v0.8.2
```

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` fires on a `v*.*.*` tag: it checks out, installs, verifies the tag equals `package.json`'s version, runs `release:verify`, and publishes with `npm publish --provenance --access public`. The tag/version guard prevents publishing a mismatched version.

One-time setup (owner, on npmjs.com): open the package → Settings → Trusted Publishing → add a GitHub Actions publisher for repo `youdie006/prodex` and workflow `publish.yml`. After that, no npm tokens are needed anywhere; revoke any previously issued automation tokens.

## Release checks

GitHub Actions runs `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run release:check`, and `npm run release:verify` on pushes to `main` and pull requests. The workflow installs `ripgrep` because the repo-search smoke checks require `rg`. It verifies release readiness only; it does not publish anything.

Before sharing a package tarball, run:

```bash
npm run smoke:package
```

This packs the project, installs the tarball into a temporary consumer project, runs the installed `prodex` binary, verifies HTTP MCP onboarding through installed token-TTL `setup`/`status`/configured `doctor`/`tunnel url`/`start`, checks `/health`, connects to the installed `/mcp` endpoint, lists tools, calls `bridge_create_task`, verifies explicit `--cwd` task storage, exercises the installed HTTP MCP repo write dry-run/apply/stage flow, exercises the installed HTTP MCP task completion/blocking/result/artifact fetch flow including tampered artifact rejection, verifies installed HTTP MCP receipt/session list/fetch tools, verifies the installed `release-pack` script and `prodex release pack` CLI success paths for normalized publish tarballs, runs `npm publish --dry-run` against those normalized tarballs, verifies git-ready release-pack output includes the tarball publish lifecycle warning and guarded `release_pack_publish` command, verifies installed release git blockers for no remote, dirty worktrees, detached HEAD, no upstream, unpushed, upstream gone, behind, and diverged states, verifies `release pack` blocks publish guidance for those unsafe git states, verifies the package is CLI-only by blocking unsupported deep imports, verifies the installed stdio MCP server exposes the expected tool catalog, exercises the installed stdio MCP repo write dry-run/apply/stage flow, verifies installed stdio oversized repo_search failure output, verifies installed stdio non-git write failure output, exercises the installed stdio MCP task completion/blocking/result/artifact fetch flow including tampered artifact rejection, and verifies installed stdio MCP receipt/session list/fetch tools.

To run the full release verification sequence:

```bash
npm run release:verify
```

This runs tests, typecheck, build, package smoke, and `doctor` without weakening the publish guard.

If direct `npm pack` is blocked because a WSL/Windows mount reports normal source files as executable, build the publish tarball from a temporary Linux staging directory:

```bash
prodex release pack --pack-destination /tmp/prodex-release
```

For a source checkout, use the built CLI with `--source-cli` so follow-up commands stay in source-checkout form:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/prodex
SOURCE_CLI="/absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js"
node "$SOURCE_CLI" release pack --source-cli "$SOURCE_CLI" --pack-destination /tmp/prodex-release
node "$SOURCE_CLI" release status --source-cli "$SOURCE_CLI"
```

The npm script is equivalent when you only need the tarball:

```bash
npm run release:pack -- --pack-destination /tmp/prodex-release
```

For source-checkout release commands, prefer the CLI wrapper when you want follow-up guidance to stay in `node dist/cli.js ... --source-cli` form. The npm script creates the same normalized tarball, but it cannot know which source CLI path should appear in later recovery commands.

`release pack` does not publish anything. It still refuses missing publish metadata, non-regular or hard-linked packed files, and missing package release checks; it only normalizes packed file modes in the staging copy so package `bin` entries remain executable and other packed files become regular `0644` files. Run `npm run release:verify` and the matching status command before publishing the tarball it creates: `prodex release status` for installed-package use, or `node /absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js release status --source-cli /absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js` from a source checkout. When the tarball is ready, `release pack` prints `release_pack_git` and `release_pack_git_next` lines before publish guidance so git remote/upstream blockers stay visible. It always prints `npm publish --dry-run <tarball>` for inspecting the exact tarball. Tarball publish commands bypass npm `prepublishOnly`, so `release pack` prints `release_pack_publish_guard` before `npm publish <tarball>`; run the dry-run command first, then publish only that verified tarball if it succeeds. If git readiness is blocked, it prints `release_pack_publish_blocked` instead.

Add `--keep-workdir` to `prodex release pack`, `node /absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js release pack --source-cli /absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js --pack-destination <dir>`, or `npm run release:pack -- ...` when you need to inspect the temporary normalized staging directory.

To see the current publish blocker and next step from the CLI:

```bash
prodex release status
```

It reports package metadata blockers, pack file-mode, non-regular file, or hard-link blockers when package identity is readable, and local git readiness, including a dirty worktree, detached HEAD, missing git remote, branch without upstream tracking, upstream is gone, branch divergence, unpushed local commits, or a branch behind upstream. For a new public repo, create the remote yourself, then run `git remote add origin <git-url>` and `git push -u origin <branch>`; `release status` prints those handoff commands when the local git state is missing a remote or upstream.

Before publishing to npm, make sure `package.json` has an npm-publishable `name` and valid semver `version`, keep the explicit MIT `license` metadata and matching `LICENSE` regular file, and make sure `package.json` does not have `private: true`. `release:check` treats missing or malformed package identity and `private: true` as publish blockers because npm will refuse to publish those packages. It also rejects a `LICENSE` path that is a directory, symlink, or hard link, rejects non-regular or symlinked packed files, blocks packed files with unexpected executable modes outside package `bin` entries, and rejects hard-linked packed files. If you are on a WSL/Windows mount that reports every file as executable, publish from a Linux filesystem, fix mount metadata/chmod first, or use `prodex release pack --pack-destination <dir>` after release verification to create the tarball from normalized staging files. From a source checkout, use `node /absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js release pack --source-cli /absolute/path/to/prodex/dist/cli.js --pack-destination <dir>` for the same normalized tarball plus source-aware follow-up guidance. Source-tree `npm publish` is intentionally guarded by `prepublishOnly`; it runs:

```bash
npm run release:check
```

If package metadata stops being publishable, `release:check` fails with a metadata error instead of letting an accidental public publish proceed. Use `npm run release:verify` when you only want local verification without claiming publish readiness.
